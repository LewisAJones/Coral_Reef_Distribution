The macrofauna is dominated by both nestlers and encrusters. Bryozoa colonies are common, although ectoproctaliths are usually less than 7 mm in diameter. These are usually of celleporiform growth-form habit (up to 3.4 cm3 mean volume) and many have been basally attached to the algal pavement for most of their development. Fully developed Crustose Pavements have between 34% and 62% framework, between 6.4% and 15.5% crustose debris and between 23% and 57% matrix (medium sand to clay-grade debris).
